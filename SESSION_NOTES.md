# SESSION_NOTES.md

Purpose: current project baseline, handoff notes, and session log for `monitorovaci_platforma`.

## Latest Baseline

Date: 2026-06-05

The user requested a read-only review of the current project state and confirmed this state should be treated as the baseline for future work. The review covered the repository root and subdirectories without intentionally modifying project files.

Baseline working tree observed before creating these context files:

```text
 M data/smartfuelpass/session_cookies.json
?? moduly/mereni/elektromery/data/
```

Observed untracked electric-meter data artifacts:

```text
moduly/mereni/elektromery/data/old/19891.ts
moduly/mereni/elektromery/data/old/19892.ts
moduly/mereni/elektromery/data/old/20445.ts
moduly/mereni/elektromery/data/old/23582.ts

moduly/mereni/elektromery/data/old/FVE 2026-02.xlsx

```

Do not inspect or clean these artifacts unless the user explicitly asks.

## Entry Points

- Scheduler: `main.py`
- Scheduler schedules: `core/scheduler/job_schedule.py`
- Scheduler runtime: `core/scheduler/scheduler.py`
- Scheduler metrics: `core/scheduler/metrics.py`
- FastAPI app: `services/api/main.py`
- API auth tokens: `services/api/core/tokens.py`
- API dependencies: `services/api/core/dependencies.py`
- Streamlit dashboard: `moduly/apps/dashboard/login.py`
- Streamlit navigation: `moduly/apps/dashboard/navigation_config.py`
- Streamlit auth: `moduly/apps/dashboard/auth.py`
- Dashboard DB model: `moduly/apps/dashboard/database/models.py`
- Dashboard DB bootstrap: `moduly/apps/dashboard/database/db_init.py`
- Streamlit config: `.streamlit/config.toml`
- Reverse proxy config: `Caddyfile`
- Experimental Next.js area: `frontend_next/`

## Current Architecture Snapshot

- The active dashboard is Streamlit.
- `frontend_next/` is experimental, not currently used in daily operation, and may be developed further later.
- FastAPI exposes health, scheduler health, auth, admin, kalorimetry, manometry, plynomery, vodomery, and web-search routers.
- PostgreSQL is the normalized storage layer for monitoring/dashboard/web-search/revision data.
- MSSQL connections exist for source or legacy operational data.
- Scheduler definitions are centralized in `core/scheduler/job_schedule.py`.
- Scheduler runtime uses locks, metrics, manual run specs, and email alerts.
- Dashboard permissions are centralized around navigation config and dashboard user records.

## Database and Schema Notes

Known schema responsibilities:

- `monitoring`: normalized measurements, anomaly scores/events, alerting/outlier data, SmartFuelPass, meteo data.
- `dashboard`: Streamlit users and permissions.
- `web_search`: monitors and search results.
- `revize`: revision/evidence records.
- `dbo`: source or legacy operational tables.
- `evidence`: QGIS/evidence device metadata.

Important time columns and concepts:

- `source_date`
- `time_utc`
- `time_basis`
- `source_timezone`
- `source_utc_offset_minutes`
- `time_fold`
- `timestamp_position`
- SmartFuelPass start/end UTC/source interval semantics.

## Domain Notes

- `vodomery`: water meters, AREAL/SCVK sources, anomaly models v1/v2/v3, event handling, alerting, outlier review, reports, billing.
- `plynomery`: gas meters, baseline and weather-adjusted models, expected-zero/outlier/alerting behavior.
- `elektromery`: electricity meters, SOFTLINK and binary imports, OTE reporting, new device discovery.
- `kalorimetry`: heat meter imports, normalization, outlier review.
- `manometry`: pressure imports, dashboard/API surfaces.
- `smartfuelpass`: card/fuel imports and reports with browser/session artifacts.
- `web_search`: monitored searches and persisted results.

Water event examples:

- `NIGHT_USAGE`
- `SPIKE`
- `LONG_LEAK`
- `ZERO_FLOW`
- `EXPECTED_ZERO_USAGE`
- `OUTLIER_REVIEW`

## Current Functional Notes

- The water-meter dashboard page for anomalies/events contains event-type filtering for currently open and historical event sections.
- The selectors support filtering examples such as `SPIKE` and `NIGHT_USAGE`.
- The active Streamlit sidebar navigation is disabled through `.streamlit/config.toml` with custom dashboard navigation handling.
- Caddy is configured to reverse proxy port `:8080` to `127.0.0.1:8001`.

## Test Inventory

Read-only inventory found:

- 52 test files.
- 335 test functions.

High-value test areas:

- Scheduler behavior.
- Measurement imports, gaps, resets, outliers, and time semantics.
- Dashboard navigation, authentication, and auto refresh.
- Reports and billing.
- SmartFuelPass import/report workflow.
- Web search workflow.

Common verification commands:

```powershell
python -m pytest tests -v --tb=short
python -m pytest tests\test_scheduler.py -v --tb=short
python -m pytest tests\test_vodomery_db_import.py -v --tb=short
python -m pytest tests\test_dashboard_navigation_config.py -v --tb=short
```

Experimental frontend verification:

```powershell
cd frontend_next
npm run typecheck
```

Use frontend verification only when the task touches `frontend_next/`.

## Open Questions and Cleanup Topics

These are recognized topics, not approved changes:

- Decide whether SmartFuelPass session files should remain tracked.
- Decide whether scheduler lock files should remain tracked.
- Decide whether `frontend_next/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` should be untracked/ignored.
- Decide whether `.gitignore` should ignore nested electric-meter data artifacts such as `moduly/mereni/elektromery/data/old/*.ts`.
- Decide whether context-file updates should be committed together with code changes or as separate documentation commits.

## Session Log

### 2026-06-05

Scope:
- Created persistent context workflow for future sessions.
- Performed read-only baseline review of the project.
- Added approved root documentation files.

Changed:
- Added `AGENTS.md`.
- Added `DECISIONS.md`.
- Added `SESSION_NOTES.md`.

Verified:
- Confirmed the context files did not already exist before writing.
- Checked working tree status before writing.

Not verified:
- No test suite was run for these documentation-only changes.

Decisions/notes:
- The current state is the baseline for future sessions.
- `frontend_next/` is experimental and not currently used in daily operation.
- Existing runtime/data artifacts were intentionally left unchanged.

Follow-up:
- Review cleanup topics only after explicit user approval.
